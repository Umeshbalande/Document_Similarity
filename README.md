# How to calculate the similarity between two documents using SentenceTransformer model
This repository contains a Flask app that can be used to calculate the similarity between two documents. The app uses the __SentenceTransformer model__, which is a pre-trained model that can be used to represent documents as vectors. The cosine similarity between two vectors is then used to measure the similarity between the two documents.

To use the app, simply follow these steps:
- Install the dependencies.
- Start the Flask server.
- Enter two texts into the text boxes and click on the "Submit" button.
- The app will then calculate the similarity between the two texts and display the results.
- Here are some additional details about the app:

The app is written in Python.
The app uses the Flask framework.
The app uses the pretrained model from hugging Face SentenceTransformer model .
The app can be used to calculate the similarity between any two documents.
I hope this helps!
